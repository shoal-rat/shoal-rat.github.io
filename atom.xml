    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello, my name is Weike Zhang. I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at Jilin University, majoring in Public Finance. I have embarked on an exciting journey to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Information Technology (IT) at the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT), aiming to complete it within two years. Concurrently, I am also working towards a Master’s degree in Economics. My unique educational path combines the insights of economics with the technical skills of computer science. If you have any questions about studying Computer Science as an Economics student, please feel free to reach out to me via email. Additionally, I am actively engaged in the GPT store, where I manage a selection of GPT models.
