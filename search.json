[{"title":"Introducing Code Mentor: Your Virtual Coding Assistant","url":"/2024/01/25/GPT-introduction-2/","content":"\nWelcome to **Code Mentor**, a specialized GPT designed to enhance your coding skills, assist in debugging, and deepen your understanding of programming concepts. Perfect for computer science students at the undergraduate level, Code Mentor offers a unique approach to learning and problem-solving in the coding world.\n\n## What is Code Mentor?\nCode Mentor is a digital assistant powered by advanced AI, tailored to support students, hobbyists, and professionals in their coding journey. Unlike traditional code editors or debugging tools, Code Mentor focuses on teaching through guidance, explanations, and logic rather than providing direct code solutions. This method ensures that learners grasp the underlying principles and improve their problem-solving skills.\n\n## How Does Code Mentor Work?\n- **Explaining Logic in Words**: Code Mentor excels in breaking down complex coding problems into understandable logic and steps, using plain language. This approach helps you understand the \"why\" and \"how\" behind solutions, fostering a deeper learning experience.\n  \n- **Debugging Assistance**: When you encounter bugs or errors in your code, Code Mentor guides you to identify and solve these issues. It encourages a hands-on approach to debugging, promoting learning through discovery and correction.\n  \n- **Direct Code Solutions (Upon Request)**: Recognizing that sometimes you might need more direct assistance, Code Mentor can provide code snippets or solutions, but only when explicitly asked. This ensures that the primary focus remains on learning and understanding, not just copying code.\n\n## How to Use Code Mentor Effectively?\n- **Be Specific with Your Questions**: The more detailed and specific your question, the more accurate and helpful Code Mentor's guidance will be. Include information about the programming language, the nature of the problem, and any error messages you're encountering.\n  \n- **Understand the Logic First**: Before asking for code, try to understand the logic or strategy Code Mentor suggests. This will enhance your learning and enable you to apply similar logic to future problems independently.\n  \n- **Engage with the Process**: Treat interactions with Code Mentor as a learning dialogue. Ask follow-up questions, seek clarifications, and try to implement the guidance provided. The goal is to develop your coding skills and problem-solving abilities.\n  \n- **Request Code When Necessary**: If after understanding the logic you still need assistance, don't hesitate to ask Code Mentor for a code example. Remember, this tool is here to support your learning journey in the way that best suits your needs.\n\n### Ten Formats for Learners\n1. **[Your Goal] + [Issues You Met] + [Error Messages] + [What You've Tried]**\n   This format ensures users clearly state their objectives, describe the problems they're facing, include any specific error messages, and outline the steps they've already taken to solve the issue.\n   \n2. **[Concept You're Struggling With] + [Specific Question] + [Context/Background]**\n   Ideal for theoretical questions, this format encourages users to specify the programming concept they're struggling with, pose a specific question about it, and provide any relevant context or background information.\n   \n3. **[Programming Language] + [Code Snippet (if applicable)] + [Expected Outcome] + [Actual Outcome]**\n   This format helps with debugging by asking users to mention the programming language, share a relevant code snippet, and clarify what they expected versus what actually happened.\n   \n4. **[Assignment/Project Objective] + [Where You're Stuck] + [Your Hypothesis on the Issue]**\n   Tailored for project or assignment help, this encourages students to explain their project's goals, identify where they're stuck, and share their hypotheses on why the issue is occurring.\n   \n5. **[Tool or Technology] + [Task You're Trying to Accomplish] + [Challenges Faced]**\n   Useful for queries related to specific tools or technologies, this format asks users to name the tool/technology, describe the task they're attempting, and detail the challenges they've encountered.\n   \n6. **[Debugging Attempts] + [Results of Each Attempt] + [Questions on Next Steps]**\n   Focusing on problem-solving processes, this format has users list their debugging attempts, the outcomes of each, and questions about what to do next.\n   \n7. **[Learning Objective] + [Resources Consulted] + [Remaining Uncertainties]**\n   For learning new concepts, users should state their learning goal, list any resources they've already consulted, and mention what uncertainties they still have.\n   \n8. **[Code Review Request] + [Specific Areas of Concern] + [Goals for Improvement]**\n   When seeking a code review, users can outline their request, point out specific areas of concern within their code, and specify their goals for improvement.\n   \n9. **[Comparison Query] + [Technologies/Concepts Compared] + [Criteria for Comparison]**\n   This format is ideal for users making comparisons between technologies or concepts, specifying what's being compared and the criteria for comparison.\n   \n10. **[Optimization Goal] + [Current Implementation] + [Performance Issues/Constraints]**\n    For optimization queries, users should describe their optimization goal, share their current implementation, and detail any performance issues or constraints they're facing.\n\n## Conclusion\nCode Mentor is more than just a coding assistant; it's your partner in the learning process. By focusing on understanding, debugging, and applying logic, it aims to build your confidence and skills in programming. Whether you're tackling a tough assignment, learning a new programming language, or debugging an intricate piece of code, Code Mentor is here to guide you every step of the way.\n\nHappy coding!","tags":["AIGC"],"categories":["GPTs"]},{"title":"考试顺利呀","url":"/2024/01/15/考试顺利呀/","content":"\n<div style=\"background-color: #f0f8ff; padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px; text-align: center; font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', cursive, sans-serif;\">\n\n🌟🌈🍀🦈🦈 <span style=\"font-size: larger; color: #32CD32;\">祝你考试顺利，成功在望！</span> 🦈🦈🍀🌈🌟\n<br>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-size: larger; color: #FF4500;\">愿好运永远伴随你，每一步都充满希望和力量。</span>\n\n</div>\n\n---\n\n## 🌹 A Sonnet for Success 🌹\n\nIn gardens where the dreams of success bloom,  \nA seed of hope in fertile soil finds room.  \nWith rays of dedication, light its way,  \nIn skies of perseverance, let it sway.\n\nEach petal, a testament to your toil,  \nIn soils of knowledge, let your roots coil.  \nThrough storms of challenges, stand ever tall,  \nFor every fall, a rise, remember all.\n\nMay luck's embrace, like gentle morning dew,  \nCaress your leaves with possibilities new.  \nLet every bloom of wisdom sweetly show,  \nIn gardens of success, may your dreams grow.\n\nFor every step, may fortune grace your days,  \nIn life's grand test, may luck guide all your ways.\n","tags":["Inspiration, GoodLuck, Success"]},{"title":"How to Build a Blog by Yourself - Part 1: GitHub","url":"/2024/01/15/blog-building/","content":"\n## Getting Started: Registering on GitHub\n\nEmbarking on the journey to build your own blog?
